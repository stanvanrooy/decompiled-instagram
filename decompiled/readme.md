## Decompiled version of the Instagram app for Android
Used to find out various details about the inner workings of the app. A really small part of the code has been updated with
more detailed class and variable names.

Note: I'm a beginner in reverse engineering, I have no good idea of what I'm doing, but so far it has worked for me :)

### Details:
