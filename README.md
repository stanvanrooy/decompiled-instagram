## Decompiled version of the Instagram app for Android
Used to find out various details about the inner workings of the app. A really small part of the code has been updated with
more detailed class and variable names.

I'll keep this repo updated with any progress I make. Maybe, just maybe it will be usefull to someone else.

For a Python package that implements what's learned from this, see [instauto](https://github.com/stanvanrooy/instauto). The package is actively in development.

Note: I'm a beginner in reverse engineering, I have no good idea of what I'm doing, but so far it has worked for me :)

### Details: 
- Version: 148.0.0.33.121
